            <h4>Differences between Jquery and Angular</h4>
            <p>Jquery is simply put a library on top of Javascript. It makes Javascript easier and more pleasant to write.
            It is not to be confused with Angular though. Angular is a framework that excels in handling two way binding.
            While Angular would be too huge a framework to implement for simple DOM manipulation, it is exceptional in showing data asynchronously
            Jquery can do the same, but with a bit more code. The clear benefit of Angular in this example is, that you don't mix Javascript and HTML.
            It is nicely split up - which can't be said about Jquery, where we have to put html in the Javascript files for it to generate it.</p>

            <h4>The DOM</h4>
            <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model.
            What that basically means is that it treats each HTML, XML or XHTML tag as an object and as a tree.
            This is what makes it possible for us to target these objects and manipulate them with Javascript.</p>

            <h4>Benefits of SPA</h4>
            <p>The benefit of single page applications are that the user will get a much more fluent and comfortable experience if done correctly.
                That is, since there will be little to almost no loading time, as everything happens asynchronously. 
            The benefits for us, as programmers is, that we can do more programming and less markup - which is nice.
            The downside of SPA is SEO - but that's another talk :)</p>

            <h4>Benefits of REST</h4>
            <p>The benefit of having an application that exposes the all the data through a REST API is, that it's easy to understand and work with.
            Another huge benefit is, that the frontend and backend are now completely seperated and decoupled which is really smart, sincethe frontend guy doesn't need to know anything about the backend.
            The only thing he needs to know are the end-points and what data he gets.</p>
